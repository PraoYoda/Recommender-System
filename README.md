# Recommender-System

Web Discovery applications like Stumble Upon, Reddit, Digg, Dice (Google Toolbar) Etc. to name a few are becoming
increasingly popular on the World Wide Web. Information on the Internet grows rapidly and users should be directed 
to high quality Websites those are relevant to their personal interests. However, there is no way to Judge these web pages. 
Displaying quality content to users based on ratings or past Search results are not adequate. 
There’s a lacking of powerful automated process combining human opinions with machine learning of personal preference. 
The goal of this project is to study recommendation engines and identify the best recommendation engines and 
to develop a web based recommendation engine by making use of user based collaborative filtering (CF) 
engine and combining context based results along with it. The system makes use of numerical ratings of 
similar items between the active user and other users of the system to assess the similarity between users’ 
profiles to predict movie recommendations of unseen items to active user. 
The results show that the system rests in its assumption that active 9 users will always react 
constructively to items rated highly by similar users, shortage of ratings of some items, 
adapt quickly to change of user's interest, and identification of potential features of an
item which could be of interest to the user.
